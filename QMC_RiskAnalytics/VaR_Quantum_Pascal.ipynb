    "Value at Risk is a common risk measure that estimates potential loss (or gain, depending on the convention). \n",

    "Going with a parametric approach, that is assuming a distribution of the analyzed data (in contrast to non-parametric approaches), we need real random variable $X$ which can model e.g. an investment and a certain distrubtion assumption. Common choices in the context of financial data for this are the normal distribution, t-distribution or fat tails. \n",

    "$$\\text{VaR}_{\\alpha} = \\text{inf}\\{x\\in \\mathbb{R} | \\mathbb{P}(X>x) \\leq 1-\\alpha\\},$$\n",
